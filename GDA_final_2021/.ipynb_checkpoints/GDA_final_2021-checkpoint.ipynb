    "In this exercise you will work on broadband data from the Mw8.2 Chile earthquake from 1st of April 2014 at 23:46:47 UTC recorded at the Black Forest Observatory (`BFO`) in SW Germany which is part of the German Regional Seismic Network (`GR`). The goal of this exercise is to show your understanding of the principal basics in signal processing. Answer the following questions and perform the necessary steps in the corresponding code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** In `cell 1a` we fetch the waveforms via the FDSN client of BGR in Hanover and remove the instrument characteristic of the data (no further coding necessary here). We also fetch the event information. Explain what \"removing the instrument response\" means and why it is necessary. Which mathematical method do you connect with this step? What is to consider during instrument response removal? A hint is given by the options used for removing the instrument response. Comment on all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Now that you have downloaded the data and removed the instrument response, which further steps do you need to perform for pre-processing (assuming you want to analyse the data in the frequency domain later on)? Assume that for your scientific task the highest frequency you want to analyse is 5Hz and that the processing workflow will eventually be applied to a large amount of data. Describe the general pre-processing chain and point out the possible pitfalls, their reasons, and how to avoid them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**c)**: Try to plot the ray paths for this specific earthquake-receiver pair. Identify which phases should theoretically be visible in the seismogram. Try to plot them along with the waveform to see if they can be seen in the seismogram.\n",

    "In Cell 4a theoretical gravity data, modeled for the location in Wettzell, are loaded. The data show a superposition of tidal effects due to different celestial bodies. Here is a short overview of the most important ones, sorted according the amplitude of their influence on Earth:\n",
    "+ tides with a period of half a day from sun, moon, Mars, Jupiter, etc. ..., period: 0.5 day \n",
    "+ tides with a period of one day from sun, moon, Mars, Jupiter, etc. ..., period: 1 days\n",

    "+ Chandler wobble (deviation of Earth's axis of rotation relative to the solid Earth), period: 433 days\n",
    "+ effects due to further planets ....\n",

    "a) In Cell 4b, calculate the spectrum of the data (what is that?) and plot it (as a log-log plot). What is the Nyquist frequency of the data. Try to identify the different tidal effects and name the frequencies of their peak positions. Why is the peak for the Chandler wobble not really visible in the spectrogram?\n",

Plot the filtered signals for the first 20 days on top of the filtered data from exercise 1b (You should have now 1 plot with 3 traces now). What differences do you see (consider amplitude and phase)? Explain the differences. With respect to the phase of the data, is there something you would like to change? What and Why?\n"
